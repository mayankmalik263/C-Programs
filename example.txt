Early life and family
Parents
Khan's father, Mir Taj Mohammed Khan, was an Indian independence activist from Peshawar who campaigned alongside the Khudai Khidmatgar, a nonviolent resistance movement led by Abdul Ghaffar Khan that sought a united and independent India.[3][4] Mir was a follower of Abdul Ghaffar Khan,[5] and affiliated with the Indian National Congress.[6] He was also the cousin of the major general in the Indian National Army Shah Nawaz Khan.[d] According to Khan his paternal grandfather, Mir Jan Muhammad Khan, was an ethnic Pashtun (Pathan) from Afghanistan.[9][6][10] However, his paternal cousins in Peshawar later clarified that the family speaks Hindko and is originally from Kashmir, from where they settled in Peshawar centuries back, contradicting the claim that his grandfather was a Pashtun from Afghanistan.[6][11] As of 2010, Khan's paternal family was still living in the Shah Wali Qataal area of Peshawar's Qissa Khwani Bazaar.[6]

In 1946, Mir moved to Delhi to study law at Delhi University.[12] When the partition of India occurred in 1947, he was forced to stay in Delhi, and did not return to Peshawar until many years later.[13] Khan's mother, Lateef Fatima, a magistrate, was the daughter of a senior government engineer.[14][d][15] His parents were married in 1959.[16]

Early life
Khan was born on 2 November 1965 into a Muslim family in New Delhi.[17] He spent the first five years of his life in Mangalore, where his maternal grandfather, Iftikhar Ahmed, served as chief engineer of the port in the 1960s.[18][19][e] Khan has described himself on Twitter as "half Hyderabadi (mother), half Pathan (father), and some Kashmiri (grandmother)".[21]

Khan grew up in the Rajendra Nagar neighbourhood of New Delhi.[22] His father had several business ventures including a restaurant, and the family lived a middle-class life in rented apartments.[23] Khan attended St. Columba's School in central Delhi where he excelled in his studies and in sports such as hockey and football,[24] and received the school's highest award, the Sword of Honour.[23] Initially Khan aspired to pursue a career in sports, however owing to a shoulder injury in his early years meant that he could no longer play.[25] Instead, in his youth, he acted in stage plays and received praise for his imitations of Bollywood actors, of which his favourites were Dilip Kumar, Amitabh Bachchan, and Mumtaz.[26] One of his childhood friends and acting partners was Amrita Singh, who became a Bollywood actress.[27] Khan enrolled at Hansraj College (1985–88) to earn his bachelor's degree in economics, but spent much of his time at Delhi's Theatre Action Group (TAG),[28] where he studied acting under the mentorship of theatre director Barry John.[29][30] After Hansraj, he began studying for a master's degree in mass communication at Jamia Millia Islamia, but left to pursue his acting career.[31][32] He also attended the National School of Drama in Delhi during his early career in Bollywood.[33]

His father died of cancer in 1981,[f] and his mother died in 1991 from complications of diabetes.[36] After the death of their parents, his older sister, Shahnaz Lalarukh (born 1960)[37] fell into a depressed state and Khan took on the responsibility of caring for her.[34][38] Shahnaz continues to live with her brother and his family in their Mumbai mansion.[39]
